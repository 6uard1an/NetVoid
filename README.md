## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Flash the ESP32**

   Flash your ESP32 with either `NetVoid.iso` or `NetVoid.bin`. This prepares the board to host the chat system.
> **Note:** `NetVoid.bin` and `NetVoid.iso` are the same firmware ‚Äî choose either format based on your preferred flashing method. It's purely for your convenience.
2. **Prepare the Flipper Zero**

   - Make sure you have the Evil Portal app installed already,
if you don't you can get it from here: [EvilPortal by bigbrodude6119](https://github.com/bigbrodude6119/flipper-zero-evil-portal).  
   - Copy the provided `Websocket.html` or `P2P.html` files to your Flipper Zero SD card under the portal directory (`SD Card/apps_data/evil_portal/html/`).

4. **Join the Chat**

   - Any device connecting to the `NetVoid` AP will be redirected to the chat page if you are not redirected, simply go to the ip address your flipper says, e.g. `AP ip: 999.888.777.666`
   - Users can begin chatting immediately
   - The Flipper Zero displays all chat messages in real-time
